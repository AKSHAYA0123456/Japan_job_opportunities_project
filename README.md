 JAVASCRIPT CODE EXPLANATION :

 This JavaScript code includes usefulness to the bookmark symbols on the site. Let's break it down:


Selecting Components:

let bookmark = document.getElementsByClassName('bookmark'):
This line chooses all components with the lesson title "bookmark" and stores them within the bookmark variable.
Including Occasion Audience members:

Array.from(bookmark).forEach(v => v.addEventListener('click', work() {...}));:
This code emphasizes over each bookmark component and includes a press occasion audience to it. When a bookmark symbol is clicked, the related work is executed.
Work Clarification:

let el = this.parentElement.getElementsByClassName('bookmark')[0]:
This line chooses the parent component of the clicked bookmark symbol and after that chooses the bookmark symbol itself inside that parent component. It expect that the parent component contains as it were one bookmark symbol.
in case (el.classList.contains("fa-heart-o")) { ... }:
This condition checks in case the bookmark icon has the lesson "fa-heart-o", demonstrating that the job isn't spared.
On the off chance that the work isn't spared:

el.classList.remove("fa-heart-o"):
Expel the "fa-heart-o" lesson.
el.classList.add("fa-heart"):
Include the "fa-heart" course to alter the symbol to a filled heart.
el.innerText = "Work spared":
Alter the content interior the bookmark symbol to "Work spared".
In case the work is as of now spared:

el.classList.remove("fa-heart"):
Evacuate the "fa-heart" lesson.
el.classList.add("fa-heart-o"):
Include the "fa-heart-o" course to alter the symbol back to an purge heart.
el.innerText = "Spare Work":
Alter the content interior the bookmark symbol to "Spare Work".
This code viably flips the appearance and content of the bookmark symbol between sparing and unsaving a work when clicked, giving a visual sign to the client that their activity has been recognized.
